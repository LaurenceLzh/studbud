>These are the four pages I designed, namely "Kanban", "Music", "Reading-list" and "Timer".
The one on the left is the iteration, and the one on the right is the original design.

#### _Considering that the previous prototype was too complex, I simplified some of the interface and functions._

# Kanban
* Removed the display of different states and color blocks in the upper kanban as the state changes, unified into a consistent kanban function. Click to switch from readingList to Kanban.
* Changed the position of edit and add buttons to a more colorful position.

# Music
* Remove the status and readingList function bar to make the interface clearer.
* The text has been shrunk to make the interface cleaner.

# Reading-List
* The classification of the three states is removed, and the different task links are grouped according to the filename.
* The original status was changed to "Open Link" to make it easier to see the function of opening all links with one click.

# Timer
* Remove the editing function, simplify the tedious multiple operations into a single operation.
* Click the time above to pause the timing of POMODORE, click again to start to continue the timing.
* Shrink the popover and move it up to prevent blocking stopwatch space.
* Remove the directional triangle symbol to reduce the redundant visual effect.
