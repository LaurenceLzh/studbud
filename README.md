>These are the four pages I designed, namely "Kanban", "Music", "Reading-list" and "Timer".
The one on the left is the iteration, and the one on the right is the original design.

#### _Considering that the previous prototype was too complex, I simplified some of the interface and functions._

# Kanban
* Removed the display of different states and color blocks in the upper kanban as the state changes, unified into a consistent kanban function. Click to switch from readingList to Kanban.
